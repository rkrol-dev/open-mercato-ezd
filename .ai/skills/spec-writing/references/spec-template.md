## Risks & Impact Review
Document concrete risks across the categories below. For each feature, answer "what can go wrong," then record mitigations and residual risk.

### Data Integrity Failures
- What happens if the operation is interrupted mid-way (crash, timeout, network failure)? Is data left in an inconsistent state?
- Are there race conditions when multiple users modify the same entity concurrently? How are conflicts resolved?
- Can partial writes occur (e.g., parent created but child entities fail)? Are transactions used to ensure atomicity?
- What happens if referenced entities are deleted while this operation is in-flight (dangling foreign keys)?

### Cascading Failures & Side Effects
- Which other modules depend on this data? If this entity is corrupted or delayed, what breaks downstream?
- Does this feature emit events? What happens if a subscriber fails: block main operation, retry, or drop?
- Are there circular dependencies between modules that could cause loops or deadlocks?
- If an external service (email, payment, webhook) is unavailable, does the operation fail or degrade gracefully?

### Tenant & Data Isolation Risks
- Can a bug in this feature leak data between tenants? Describe the exact isolation boundary.
- Are there shared/global resources (caches, queues, counters) that could cause cross-tenant interference?
- What happens if a single tenant has far more data than others? Is noisy-neighbor impact bounded?

### Migration & Deployment Risks
- Can this change be deployed without downtime? Is migration backward-compatible?
- If migration fails halfway, can it be safely re-run or rolled back?
- Does this require data backfill? How long on millions of rows, and can traffic continue during backfill?
- Are there breaking API contract changes? How are existing clients protected?

### Operational Risks
- What monitoring/alerting gaps remain? How does on-call detect failure quickly?
- What is the blast radius if this feature fails entirely: isolated module or tenant-wide/system-wide effect?
- Are there rate-limiting/throttling concerns (bulk operations, event storms, notification floods)?
- What are storage growth implications at scale (audit logs, version history, generated artifacts)?

### Risk Register (Required Format)

Use this format for every explicit risk:

```markdown
#### [Risk Title]
- **Scenario**: What exactly goes wrong and under what conditions
- **Severity**: Critical / High / Medium / Low
- **Affected area**: Which modules, APIs, or user-facing features are impacted
- **Mitigation**: How the design addresses this (transaction boundaries, retry logic, circuit breaker, fallback)
- **Residual risk**: What remains unmitigated and why it is acceptable
```

## Final Compliance Report
Use this exact structure:

```markdown
## Final Compliance Report — {YYYY-MM-DD}

### AGENTS.md Files Reviewed
- `AGENTS.md` (root)
- `packages/core/AGENTS.md`
- `packages/<relevant>/AGENTS.md`
- ...

### Compliance Matrix

| Rule Source | Rule | Status | Notes |
|-------------|------|--------|-------|
| root AGENTS.md | No direct ORM relationships between modules | Compliant | Uses FK IDs only |
| root AGENTS.md | Filter by organization_id | Compliant | All queries scoped |
| packages/core/AGENTS.md | API routes MUST export openApi | Non-compliant | Missing on GET /api/... |
| packages/cache/AGENTS.md | Tag-based invalidation | Compliant | Tags declared in cache section |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Internal Consistency Check

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Data models match API contracts | Pass / Fail | ... |
| API contracts match UI/UX section | Pass / Fail | ... |
| Risks cover all write operations | Pass / Fail | ... |
| Commands defined for all mutations | Pass / Fail | ... |
| Cache strategy covers all read APIs | Pass / Fail | ... |

### Non-Compliant Items

For each non-compliant item:
- **Rule**: Exact rule text
- **Source**: Which AGENTS.md file
- **Gap**: What is missing or wrong
- **Recommendation**: Specific fix needed

### Verdict

- **Fully compliant**: Approved — ready for implementation
- **Non-compliant**: Blocked — items must be resolved before implementation
