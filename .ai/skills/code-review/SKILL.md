# Code Review

Review code changes against Open Mercato's architecture rules, security requirements, naming conventions, and quality standards. Produce actionable, categorized findings.

## Review Workflow

1. **Scope**: Identify changed files. Classify each file by layer (API route, entity, validator, backend page, frontend page, subscriber, worker, command, search config, setup, ACL, events, DI, widget, test).
2. **Gather context**: Read relevant AGENTS.md for each touched module/package. Check `.ai/specs/` for active specs on the module. Read `.ai/lessons.md` for known pitfalls.
3. **Run checklist**: Apply all applicable rules from `references/review-checklist.md`. Flag violations with severity, file, line, and fix suggestion.
4. **Cross-module impact**: If the change touches events, extensions, or widgets, verify the consuming side handles the contract correctly.
5. **Output**: Produce the review report in the format below.

## Output Format

Use this structure for every review:

```markdown
# Code Review: {PR title or change description}

## Summary
{1-3 sentences: what the change does, overall assessment}

## Findings

### Critical
{Violations that MUST be fixed before merge — security, data integrity, tenant isolation}

### High
{Architecture violations, missing required exports, broken conventions}

### Medium
{Style issues, missing best practices, suboptimal patterns}

### Low
{Suggestions, minor improvements, nits}

## Checklist
- [ ] No `any` types introduced
- [ ] All API routes export `openApi`
- [ ] Validators in `data/validators.ts` (not inline)
- [ ] Tenant isolation: queries filter by `organization_id`
- [ ] No hardcoded user-facing strings
- [ ] CRUD routes use `makeCrudRoute` with `indexer`
- [ ] Events declared in `events.ts` before emitting
- [ ] Workers/subscribers export `metadata`
- [ ] Custom fields use `collectCustomFieldValues()`
- [ ] `modules:prepare` needed after file additions
- [ ] No cross-module ORM relationships
- [ ] Encryption helpers used instead of raw `em.find`
- [ ] Forms use `CrudForm`, tables use `DataTable`
- [ ] `apiCall` used instead of raw `fetch`
- [ ] ACL features mirrored in `setup.ts` `defaultRoleFeatures`
```

Omit empty severity sections. Mark passing checklist items with `[x]` and failing with `[ ]` plus explanation.

## Severity Classification

| Severity | Criteria | Action |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **Critical** | Security vulnerability, cross-tenant data leak, data corruption risk, missing auth guard | MUST fix before merge |
| **High** | Architecture violation, missing required export (`openApi`, `metadata`), broken module contract | MUST fix before merge |
| **Medium** | Convention violation, suboptimal pattern, missing best practice | Should fix |
| **Low** | Style suggestion, minor improvement, readability | Nice to have |

## Quick Rule Reference

These are the highest-impact rules. For the full checklist, see `references/review-checklist.md`.

### Architecture (Critical/High)

- **NO direct ORM relationships between modules** — use FK IDs, fetch separately
- **Always filter by `organization_id`** for tenant-scoped entities — never expose cross-tenant data
- **Use DI (Awilix)** to inject services — never `new` directly
- **NO direct module-to-module function calls** for side effects — use events
- **Cross-module data**: use extension entities + `data/extensions.ts` — never add columns to another module's table

### Security (Critical)

- **Validate all inputs with zod** in `data/validators.ts` — never trust raw input
- **Use `findWithDecryption`** instead of raw `em.find`/`em.findOne`
- **Hash passwords with bcryptjs (cost >= 10)** — never log credentials
- **Auth endpoints**: return minimal error messages — never reveal if email exists
- **Every endpoint MUST declare guards** (`requireAuth`, `requireRoles`, `requireFeatures`)
- **Sensitive fields**: MUST define `fieldPolicy.excluded` in search config
- **MUST NOT cache** passwords, tokens, PII without encryption

### Data Integrity (Critical/High)

- **Never hand-write migrations** — update entities, run `yarn db:generate`
- **Use `withAtomicFlush`** when mutating entities across phases that include queries
- **Flush scalar changes BEFORE** relation syncs — avoid `__originalEntityData` reset
- **Workers/subscribers MUST be idempotent** — they may be retried
- **Commands MUST be undoable** — include before/after snapshots

### Naming & Structure (High/Medium)

- Modules: **plural, snake_case** (folders and `id`)
- JS/TS identifiers: **camelCase**
- Database tables/columns: **snake_case**, table names plural
- Common columns: `id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `deleted_at`, `is_active`, `organization_id`, `tenant_id`
- UUID PKs, explicit FKs, junction tables for many-to-many
- Code MUST NOT be added directly in `apps/mercato/src/` — use `apps/mercato/src/modules/`
- Shared package (`@open-mercato/shared`) has **zero domain dependencies** — MUST NOT import from `@open-mercato/core`

### Required Exports (High)

| File | Required Export | Rule |
|------|----------------|------|
| API routes | `openApi` | MUST export for doc generation |
| API routes | `metadata` | MUST declare auth guards |
| Subscribers | `metadata` with `{ event, persistent?, id? }` | MUST for auto-discovery |
| Workers | `metadata` with `{ queue, id?, concurrency? }` | MUST for auto-discovery |
| `events.ts` | `eventsConfig` via `createModuleEvents()` with `as const` | MUST for type-safe events |
| `acl.ts` | `features` | MUST mirror in `setup.ts` `defaultRoleFeatures` |
| `search.ts` | `searchConfig` with `checksumSource` in every `buildSource` | MUST for change detection |

### UI & HTTP (Medium/High)

- Forms: `CrudForm` — never custom form implementations
- Tables: `DataTable` — never manual table markup
- Notifications: `flash()` — never `alert()` or custom toast
- API calls: `apiCall`/`apiCallOrThrow` — never raw `fetch`
- JSON reading: `readJsonSafe(response, fallback)` — never `.json().catch()`
- CRUD errors: `createCrudFormError(message, fieldErrors?)` — never raw throw
- Dialogs: MUST support `Cmd/Ctrl+Enter` (submit), `Escape` (cancel)
- `RowActions` items MUST have stable `id` values (`edit`, `open`, `delete`)
- `pageSize` MUST be <= 100
- i18n: `useT()` client-side, `resolveTranslations()` server-side — never hardcode strings

### Code Quality (Medium)

- **No `any` types** — use zod + `z.infer`, narrow with runtime checks
- **No one-letter variable names**
- **No inline comments** — code should be self-documenting
- **Boolean parsing**: use `parseBooleanToken`/`parseBooleanWithDefault` from `@open-mercato/shared/lib/boolean`
- **Prefer functional, data-first utilities** over classes
- **Don't add docstrings/comments/annotations** to code you didn't change

## Review Heuristics

When reviewing, pay special attention to:

1. **New files added**: Check if `modules:prepare` is needed. Verify auto-discovery paths are correct.
2. **Entity changes**: Check if `yarn db:generate` is needed. Look for missing tenant scoping columns.
3. **New API routes**: Verify `openApi` export, auth guards, zod validation, tenant filtering.
4. **Event emitters**: Verify event is declared in `events.ts` with `as const`. Check subscriber exists.
5. **Search config changes**: Verify `checksumSource`, `fieldPolicy.excluded` for sensitive fields, `formatResult` for token strategy.
6. **Cache usage**: Verify DI resolution, tenant scoping, tag-based invalidation on writes.
7. **Queue workers**: Verify idempotency, `metadata` export, concurrency <= 20.
8. **Commands**: Verify undoable, before/after snapshots, `withAtomicFlush` for multi-phase mutations.
9. **Setup changes**: Verify `defaultRoleFeatures` matches `acl.ts` features. Hooks MUST be idempotent.
10. **UI changes**: Verify `CrudForm`/`DataTable` usage, `flash()` for feedback, keyboard shortcuts, loading/error states.

## Lessons Learned

Check these known pitfalls from `.ai/lessons.md`:

1. **Stale snapshots in `buildLog()`**: Always load via forked `EntityManager` or `refresh: true`
2. **Lost updates on flush**: Flush scalar changes BEFORE relation syncs that query on same `EntityManager`
3. **Undo payload duplication**: Use centralized `extractUndoPayload()` from `@open-mercato/shared/lib/commands/undo.ts`
